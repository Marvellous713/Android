The app-debug.apk file attached to this repository is an body mass index (BMI) calculator that takes height and weight as inputs. This interactive app offers users seamless interaction in determining their BMI. The app takes a person's weight and height as inputs and uses these two variables to calculate their BMI. The app will then automatically output the user's BMI along with their weight category. The category will inform the user on if he/she is in the normal range, overweight or obese.
